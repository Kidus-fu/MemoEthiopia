Claiming you’re tough, but your heart is cursed.

Verse 4: አቅጣጫዬ ለመልካም የይቅርታ አይወዳ

You're just a kid, stuck in your own lore,
Time to wake up, man, what are you waiting for?

Verse 10: እንደ በርቱዕ ወይ ወርከ ወነገር
You thought you could win, but I’m bringing the fire,
Your throne is empty, your dreams are dire,
Next Level's here, and I’m climbing higher.

Chorus: Stop loving girls, get back to the drill,
Next Level is here, I'm ready to kill,
I’m calling you out, man, this is the deal,
